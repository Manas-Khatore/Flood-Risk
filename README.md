# Flood-Risk
I worked with three other students to create this project through the General Member program in Data Science Society @ UC Berkeley. Inspired by the movie "Parasite," we wanted to investigate any possible association between elevation, income, and flood risk for congressional districts in the state of New York. We utilized hypothesis testing through bootstrapping to determine whether there is a linear relationship between income/elevation and flood risk; after this, we built a linear regression model that is able to predict flood risk from the income or elevation of a particular district. The purpose of this project was to determine whether income or elevation (or a combination) is a better predictor of flood risk for New York congressional districts.

This project was presented at the Data Science Society Symposium on 11/30/2021, as well as the Berkeley EECS and Research Symposium on 12/02/2021 that also featured research from Machine Learning at Berkeley, Student Association for Applied Statistics, and the Berkeley Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 

Tools used include:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sci-kit learn
- Google Maps API
- datascience module from UC Berkeley's Data 8 course (syntactically similar to pandas)
